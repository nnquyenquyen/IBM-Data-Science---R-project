# IBM-Data-Science---R-project
This project leverages the Global Bike Sharing dataset from Wikipedia and the OpenWeather API to investigate the dynamic relationship between weather conditions and urban bike-sharing demand. The dataset, comprised of Global Bike Sharing System data, offers a comprehensive glimpse into bike-sharing trends across various urban areas. Paired with real-time weather data obtained from the OpenWeather API, this project delves into the intriguing question of how weather influences the usage of bike-sharing systems.

## Project Goals:

1. **Data Exploration**: Begin by thoroughly exploring the Global Bike Sharing dataset to gain insights into bike-sharing patterns, including usage during different times of the day, days of the week, and across seasons.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: Conduct statistical analyses to identify correlations and potential causal relationships between weather conditions and bike-sharing demand.

3. **Visualization**: Create compelling visualizations that illustrate how weather variables impact bike-sharing ridership. 

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models to forecast bike-sharing demand based on weather forecasts.

## Dataset Sources:

- **Global Bike Sharing System Dataset:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle-sharing_systems

- **OpenWeather API Data:** Real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, obtained via the OpenWeather API for the same urban areas featured in the bike-sharing dataset.
